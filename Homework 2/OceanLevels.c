Assuming the ocean’s level is currently rising at about 1.5 millimeters per year, write
a program that displays:
• The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean’s level will be
in 5 years
• The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean’s level will be
in 7 years
• The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean’s level will be
in 10 years
